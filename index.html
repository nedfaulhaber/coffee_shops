          <p>Laid-back is the key word at Anna Bannanas - the sign outside says to come in and “catch a breath”, while the owners are the self-proclaimed “champions of chill”. It’s got an eclectic, bohemian assortment of comfy furniture, with a lived-in quality that is the absolute opposite of industrial-chic. The framed picture of Jerry Garcia is a clue to the old hippie vibe that subtly inhabits the place, as does the whimsical artwork on the old brick walls and the little castle for kids to play in. Though the place is usually crowded, its got a lot of space to accommodate them.

The coffee here is top- notch and will impress any aficionado out there - and well worth the trip up north.
